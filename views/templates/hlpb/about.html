	<h2>Highland Light Scottish Pipe Band</h2>
	<p>For over thirty-nine years, the Highland Light Scottish Pipe Band has been thrilling audiences with the traditional music and spectacle of the Great Highland Bagpipes and Drums. The band is comprised of members from Cape Cod and South Eastern Massachusetts, ranging from 16 to 60 (or so) years old. Many of the players learned to play the pipes or drums through the bagpipe and drum lessons we offer to prospective members, and some of the players had previous musical and pipe band experience. A few of the members not only play with the band, but also compete in the highland game solo competition circuit. We've got pipers competing in up to grade 2, drummers competing at grade 4 and as a band, we're competing in grade 5. At the end of the day, we're a family oriented band, with multiple couples playing in the band together, as well as members who've come to play with us because their parents or grandparents are members. If you're interested in becoming a part of the family, contact the band manager, or check out the <a href="/join">info about joining the band</a> and lessons.</p>

			The Band's beginnings can be traced to the early 1970's, when an evening class in introductory piping was taught at Dennis-Yarmouth High School, by William "Bill" Andrew Brittain and Bruce Cameron Williams. Bill became the first Pipe Major of the Band and Bruce, the first Pipe Sergeant when it was organized a short time later. Highland Light's first public appearance was in 1978 at a parade in Falmouth. The Band's name is taken from <a href="http://www.capecodlight.org/">Highland Light,</a> also known as Cape Cod Light, an historical lighthouse in Truro, Mass. The band name also echoes the name of an historic Scottish regiment, The Highland Light Infantry regiment. To that end, the band continues in true Scottish tradition, wearing the full dress military uniform during some performances. To this day, the band continues to learn, teach, and play the Great Highland Bagpipe with the same attention to dress and deportment as our ancestors.</p>

	<h3>Performances:</h3>
	<p>The Band plays a full schedule of parades and concerts each year on Cape Cod, southeastern Massachusetts and beyond. We also have a competitive streak, and prepare a yearly competition set to be presented at Highland Games throughout the Northeast, which culminates in the <a href="https://nhscot.org/">Loon Mountain Highland Games</a>. Highland Light is noted for presenting the best of the traditional repertoire for pipes and drums in a style based on the traditions of the Highland regiments. With a full spectrum of marches, slow aires, and the occasional Irish tune, the band is prepared for anything. If you're interested in coming to see us, the <a href="/events">performances</a> we have scheduled are kept up to date. We enjoy new challenges, and opportunities to bring the Scottish culture to new audiences, and encourage you to contact the band manager for details. </p>

	<h3>Competition Group:</h3>
	<p>Highland Light fields a competition group as a Grade V band, several times a year at <a href="http://www.euspba.org/" target="_blank" >Eastern United States Pipe Band Association</a> sanctioned Highland games. See our <a href="/events">events</a> Page for places, dates and times. The competition group is made up of members of the band who have proven themselves on their instruments. The newest additions to the group were student pipers with the band not long ago, and, through their hardwork, are able to play and compete at the Highland Games. Competition sets are comprised of three marches, with different musical "feeling", which, when played together, take the audience for a auditory journey.</p>
