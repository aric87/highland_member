		<h3>History:</h3>
		<p>The Band's beginnings can be traced to the early 1970's, when an evening class in introductory piping was taught at Dennis-Yarmouth High School, by William "Bill" Andrew Brittain and Bruce Cameron Williams. Bill became the first Pipe Major of the Band and Bruce, the first Pipe Sergeant when it was organized a short time later. HLSPB's first public appearance was in 1978 at a parade in Falmouth. The Band's name is taken from <a href="http://www.capecodlight.org/">Highland Light,</a> also known as Cape Cod Light, an historical lighthouse in Truro. It also echoes the
  name of an historic Scottish regiment, The Highland Light Infantry regiment.</p>
